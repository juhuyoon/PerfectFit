Authentication:
  - Interested in rolling our own instead of passport?
    If so: https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/

Database:
  - Resolved the order of seeds being installed by putting them in alphabetical order

  - Objection.js (Should you set a model for each table? Is it good practice?)

  (Setting defaultTo(0) for false) 
Application Structure:
  - I had something in mind that slightly deviates from traditional but I wanted to go over it with you
