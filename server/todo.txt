Authentication:
  - Interested in rolling our own instead of passport?
    If so: https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/

Database:
  - Should I set the increments of IDs to be bigIncrement or Increment? 
  (8 byte vs 4 byte, but according to reading, it seems that the difference in negligible )
  (Do you think there will be any issues for how bigint data returns as a string in queries?)
  (Setting defaultTo(0) for false, defaultTo(knex.fn.now()) for current Date )
Application Structure:
  - I had something in mind that slightly deviates from traditional but I wanted to go over it with you
